    <para>This is the official reference guide for the <link

        will find either the definitive documentation on an HBase topic as of its standing when the
        referenced HBase version shipped, or it will point to the location in <link

        <title>Heads-up if this is your first foray into the world of distributed
            computing...</title>
        <para> If this is your first foray into the wonderful world of Distributed Computing, then
            you are in for some interesting times. First off, distributed systems are hard; making a
            distributed system hum requires a disparate skillset that spans systems (hardware and
            software) and networking. Your cluster' operation can hiccup because of any of a myriad
            set of reasons from bugs in HBase itself through misconfigurations -- misconfiguration
            of HBase but also operating system misconfigurations -- through to hardware problems
            whether it be a bug in your network card drivers or an underprovisioned RAM bus (to
            mention two recent examples of hardware issues that manifested as "HBase is slow"). You
            will also need to do a recalibration if up to this your computing has been bound to a
            single box. Here is one good starting point: <link
                xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacies_of_Distributed_Computing">Fallacies
                of Distributed Computing</link>. That said, you are welcome. Its a fun place to be.
            Yours, the HBase Community. </para>
