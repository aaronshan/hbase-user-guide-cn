    <title>数据模型</title>
    <para>In HBase, data is stored in tables, which have rows and columns. This is a terminology
      overlap with relational databases (RDBMSs), but this is not a helpful analogy. Instead, it can
    be helpful to think of an HBase table as a multi-dimensional map.</para>

      <title>HBase Data Model Terminology</title>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Table</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>An HBase table consists of multiple rows.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Row</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>A row in HBase consists of a row key and one or more columns with values associated
            with them. Rows are sorted alphabetically by the row key as they are stored. For this
            reason, the design of the row key is very important. The goal is to store data in such a
            way that related rows are near each other. A common row key pattern is a website domain.
            If your row keys are domains, you should probably store them in reverse (org.apache.www,
            org.apache.mail, org.apache.jira). This way, all of the Apache domains are near each
            other in the table, rather than being spread out based on the first letter of the
            subdomain.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Column</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>A column in HBase consists of a column family and a column qualifier, which are
            delimited by a <literal>:</literal> (colon) character.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Column Family</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>Column families physically colocate a set of columns and their values, often for
            performance reasons. Each column family has a set of storage properties, such as whether
            its values should be cached in memory, how its data is compressed or its row keys are
            encoded, and others. Each row in a table has the same column
            families, though a given row might not store anything in a given column family.</para>
          <para>Column families are specified when you create your table, and influence the way your
            data is stored in the underlying filesystem. Therefore, the column families should be
            considered carefully during schema design.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Column Qualifier</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>A column qualifier is added to a column family to provide the index for a given
            piece of data. Given a column family <literal>content</literal>, a column qualifier
            might be <literal>content:html</literal>, and another might be
            <literal>content:pdf</literal>. Though column families are fixed at table creation,
            column qualifiers are mutable and may differ greatly between rows.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Cell</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>A cell is a combination of row, column family, and column qualifier, and contains a
            value and a timestamp, which represents the value's version.</para>
          <para>A cell's value is an uninterpreted array of bytes.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Timestamp</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>A timestamp is written alongside each value, and is the identifier for a given
            version of a value. By default, the timestamp represents the time on the RegionServer
            when the data was written, but you can specify a different timestamp value when you put
            data into the cell.</para>
          <caution>
            <para>Direct manipulation of timestamps is an advanced feature which is only exposed for
              special cases that are deeply integrated with HBase, and is discouraged in general.
              Encoding a timestamp at the application level is the preferred pattern.</para>
          </caution>
          <para>You can specify the maximum number of versions of a value that HBase retains, per column
            family. When the maximum number of versions is reached, the oldest versions are 
            eventually deleted. By default, only the newest version is kept.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>

    <section
      xml:id="conceptual.view">
      <title>Conceptual View</title>
      <para>You can read a very understandable explanation of the HBase data model in the blog post <link
          xlink:href="http://jimbojw.com/wiki/index.php?title=Understanding_Hbase_and_BigTable">Understanding
          HBase and BigTable</link> by Jim R. Wilson. Another good explanation is available in the
        PDF <link
          xlink:href="http://0b4af6cdc2f0c5998459-c0245c5c937c5dedcca3f1764ecc9b2f.r43.cf2.rackcdn.com/9353-login1210_khurana.pdf">Introduction
          to Basic Schema Design</link> by Amandeep Khurana. It may help to read different
        perspectives to get a solid understanding of HBase schema design. The linked articles cover
        the same ground as the information in this section.</para>
      <para> The following example is a slightly modified form of the one on page 2 of the <link
          xlink:href="http://research.google.com/archive/bigtable.html">BigTable</link> paper. There
        is a table called <varname>webtable</varname> that contains two rows
        (<literal>com.cnn.www</literal>
          and <literal>com.example.www</literal>), three column families named
          <varname>contents</varname>, <varname>anchor</varname>, and <varname>people</varname>. In
          this example, for the first row (<literal>com.cnn.www</literal>), 
          <varname>anchor</varname> contains two columns (<varname>anchor:cssnsi.com</varname>,
          <varname>anchor:my.look.ca</varname>) and <varname>contents</varname> contains one column
          (<varname>contents:html</varname>). This example contains 5 versions of the row with the
        row key <literal>com.cnn.www</literal>, and one version of the row with the row key
        <literal>com.example.www</literal>. The <varname>contents:html</varname> column qualifier contains the entire
        HTML of a given website. Qualifiers of the <varname>anchor</varname> column family each
        contain the external site which links to the site represented by the row, along with the
        text it used in the anchor of its link. The <varname>people</varname> column family represents
        people associated with the site.
      </para>
        <note>
          <title>Column Names</title>
        <para> By convention, a column name is made of its column family prefix and a
            <emphasis>qualifier</emphasis>. For example, the column
            <emphasis>contents:html</emphasis> is made up of the column family
            <varname>contents</varname> and the <varname>html</varname> qualifier. The colon
          character (<literal>:</literal>) delimits the column family from the column family
            <emphasis>qualifier</emphasis>. </para>

        Thus a request for the value of the <varname>contents:html</varname> column at time stamp
          <literal>t8</literal> would return no value. Similarly, a request for an
          <varname>anchor:my.look.ca</varname> value at time stamp <literal>t9</literal> would
        return no value. However, if no timestamp is supplied, the most recent value for a
        particular column would be returned. Given multiple versions, the most recent is also the
        first one found,  since timestamps
        are stored in descending order. Thus a request for the values of all columns in the row
          <varname>com.cnn.www</varname> if no timestamp is specified would be: the value of

      <para>A <emphasis>{row, column, version} </emphasis>tuple exactly specifies a

        the row and column are the same but the cell address differs only in its version
        dimension.</para>

      <para>While rows and column keys are expressed as bytes, the version is specified using a long
        integer. Typically this long contains time instances such as those returned by
          <code>java.util.Date.getTime()</code> or <code>System.currentTimeMillis()</code>, that is:
          <quote>the difference, measured in milliseconds, between the current time and midnight,
          January 1, 1970 UTC</quote>.</para>

      <para>The HBase version dimension is stored in decreasing order, so that when reading from a

      <para>There is a lot of confusion over the semantics of <literal>cell</literal> versions, in

      <itemizedlist>

          <para>Gets are implemented on top of Scans. The below discussion of <link

          <para>By default, i.e. if you specify no explicit version, when doing a
              <literal>get</literal>, the cell whose version has the largest value is returned
            (which may or may not be the latest one written, see later). The default behavior can be
            modified in the following ways:</para>

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>to return more than one version, see <link

              <para>To retrieve the latest version that is less than or equal to a given value, thus
                giving the 'latest' state of the record at a certain point in time, just use a range

            <para>Caution: the version timestamp is internally by HBase for things like time-to-live

          <para>When deleting an entire row, HBase will internally create a tombstone for each
            ColumnFamily (i.e., not each individual column). </para>
          <para>Deletes work by creating <emphasis>tombstone</emphasis> markers. For example, let's
            suppose we want to delete a row. For this you can specify a version, or else by default
            the <literal>currentTimeMillis</literal> is used. What this means is <quote>delete all
              cells where the version is less than or equal to this version</quote>. HBase never
            modifies data in place, so for example a delete will not immediately delete (or mark as
            deleted) the entries in the storage file that correspond to the delete condition.
            Rather, a so-called <emphasis>tombstone</emphasis> is written, which will mask the
            deleted values<footnote>
              <para>When HBase does a major compaction, the tombstones are processed to actually
                remove the dead values, together with the tombstones themselves.</para>
            </footnote>. If the version you specified when deleting a row is larger than the version
            of any value in the row, then you can consider the complete row to be deleted.</para>
          <para>For an informative discussion on how deletes and versioning interact, see the thread <link

              linkend="keyvalue" /> for more information on the internal KeyValue format. </para>
          <para>Delete markers are purged during the next major compaction of the store, unless the
              <option>KEEP_DELETED_CELLS</option> option is set in the column family. To keep the
            deletes for a configurable amount of time, you can set the delete TTL via the
              <option>hbase.hstore.time.to.purge.deletes</option> property in
              <filename>hbase-site.xml</filename>. If
              <option>hbase.hstore.time.to.purge.deletes</option> is not set, or set to 0, all
            delete markers, including those with timestamps in the future, are purged during the
            next major compaction. Otherwise, a delete marker with a timestamp in the future is kept
            until the major compaction which occurs after the time represented by the marker's
            timestamp plus the value of <option>hbase.hstore.time.to.purge.deletes</option>, in

            </footnote>. Remember that a delete writes a tombstone, which only
          disappears after then next major compaction has run. Suppose you do
          a delete of everything &lt;= T. After this you do a new put with a
          timestamp &lt;= T. This put, even if it happened after the delete,
          will be masked by the delete tombstone. Performing the put will not
          fail, but when you do a get you will notice the put did have no
          effect. It will start working again after the major compaction has
          run. These issues should not be a problem if you use
          always-increasing versions for new puts to a row. But they can occur
          even if you do not care about time: just do delete and put
          immediately after each other, and there is some chance they happen
          within the same millisecond.</para>

      <para>Whether HBase supports joins is a common question on the dist-list, and there is a simple answer:  it doesn't,
      at not least in the way that RDBMS' support them (e.g., with equi-joins or outer-joins in SQL).  As has been illustrated
      in this chapter, the read data model operations in HBase are Get and Scan.
      </para>
      <para>However, that doesn't mean that equivalent join functionality can't be supported in your application, but
      you have to do it yourself.  The two primary strategies are either denormalizing the data upon writing to HBase,
      or to have lookup tables and do the join between HBase tables in your application or MapReduce code (and as RDBMS'
      demonstrate, there are several strategies for this depending on the size of the tables, e.g., nested loops vs.
      hash-joins).  So which is the best approach?  It depends on what you are trying to do, and as such there isn't a single
      answer that works for every use case.

    <title>HBase和MapReduce</title>
    <para>Apache MapReduce is a software framework used to analyze large amounts of data, and is
      the framework used most often with <link
        xlink:href="http://hadoop.apache.org/">Apache Hadoop</link>. MapReduce itself is out of the
      scope of this document. A good place to get started with MapReduce is <link
        xlink:href="http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r1.2.1/mapred_tutorial.html" />. MapReduce version
      2 (MR2)is now part of <link
        xlink:href="http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.3.0/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/">YARN</link>. </para>

    <para> This chapter discusses specific configuration steps you need to take to use MapReduce on
      data within HBase. In addition, it discusses other interactions and issues between HBase and
      MapReduce jobs.
      <note> 
      <title>mapred and mapreduce</title>
      <para>There are two mapreduce packages in HBase as in MapReduce itself: <filename>org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapred</filename>
      and <filename>org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce</filename>. The former does old-style API and the latter
      the new style.  The latter has more facility though you can usually find an equivalent in the older
      package.  Pick the package that goes with your mapreduce deploy.  When in doubt or starting over, pick the
      <filename>org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce</filename>.  In the notes below, we refer to
      o.a.h.h.mapreduce but replace with the o.a.h.h.mapred if that is what you are using.

    <section
      xml:id="hbase.mapreduce.classpath">
      <title>HBase, MapReduce, and the CLASSPATH</title>
      <para>Ny default, MapReduce jobs deployed to a MapReduce cluster do not have access to either
        the HBase configuration under <envar>$HBASE_CONF_DIR</envar> or the HBase classes.</para>
      <para>To give the MapReduce jobs the access they need, you could add
          <filename>hbase-site.xml</filename> to the
            <filename><replaceable>$HADOOP_HOME</replaceable>/conf/</filename> directory and add the
        HBase JARs to the <filename><replaceable>HADOOP_HOME</replaceable>/conf/</filename>
        directory, then copy these changes across your cluster. You could add hbase-site.xml to
        $HADOOP_HOME/conf and add HBase jars to the $HADOOP_HOME/lib. You would then need to copy
        these changes across your cluster or edit
          <filename><replaceable>$HADOOP_HOME</replaceable>conf/hadoop-env.sh</filename> and add
        them to the <envar>HADOOP_CLASSPATH</envar> variable. However, this approach is not
        recommended because it will pollute your Hadoop install with HBase references. It also
        requires you to restart the Hadoop cluster before Hadoop can use the HBase data.</para>
      <para> Since HBase 0.90.x, HBase adds its dependency JARs to the job configuration itself. The
        dependencies only need to be available on the local CLASSPATH. The following example runs
        the bundled HBase <link

        the environment variables expected in the command (the parts prefixed by a
          <literal>$</literal> sign and curly braces), you can use the actual system paths instead.
        Be sure to use the correct version of the HBase JAR for your system. The backticks
          (<literal>`</literal> symbols) cause ths shell to execute the sub-commands, setting the
        CLASSPATH as part of the command. This example assumes you use a BASH-compatible shell. </para>

      <para>When the command runs, internally, the HBase JAR finds the dependencies it needs for
        zookeeper, guava, and its other dependencies on the passed <envar>HADOOP_CLASSPATH</envar>
        and adds the JARs to the MapReduce job configuration. See the source at
        TableMapReduceUtil#addDependencyJars(org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.Job) for how this is done. </para>
      <note>
        <para> The example may not work if you are running HBase from its build directory rather
          than an installed location. You may see an error like the following:</para>
        <screen>java.lang.RuntimeException: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce.RowCounter$RowCounterMapper</screen>
        <para>If this occurs, try modifying the command as follows, so that it uses the HBase JARs
          from the <filename>target/</filename> directory within the build environment.</para>

        <para>This is caused by an optimization introduced in <link
            xlink:href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-9867">HBASE-9867</link> that
          inadvertently introduced a classloader dependency. </para>
        <para>This affects both jobs using the <code>-libjars</code> option and "fat jar," those
          which package their runtime dependencies in a nested <code>lib</code> folder.</para>
        <para>In order to satisfy the new classloader requirements, hbase-protocol.jar must be
          included in Hadoop's classpath. See <xref

          classpath errors. The following is included for historical purposes.</para>

          xlink:href="http://hbase.apache.org/apidocs/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/mapreduce/MultiTableOutputFormat.html">MultiTableOutputFormat</link>,
        for MapReduce jobs. Writing MapReduce jobs that read or write HBase, it is advisable to
        subclass <link
          xlink:href="http://hbase.apache.org/apidocs/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/mapreduce/TableMapper.html">TableMapper</link>
        and/or <link

        for basic usage. For a more involved example, see <link
          xlink:href="http://hbase.apache.org/apidocs/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/mapreduce/RowCounter.html">RowCounter</link>
        or review the <code>org.apache.hadoop.hbase.mapreduce.TestTableMapReduce</code> unit test. </para>
      <para>If you run MapReduce jobs that use HBase as source or sink, need to specify source and
        sink table and column names in your configuration.</para>

      <para>When you read from HBase, the <code>TableInputFormat</code> requests the list of regions
        from HBase and makes a map, which is either a <code>map-per-region</code> or
          <code>mapreduce.job.maps</code> map, whichever is smaller. If your job only has two maps,
        raise <code>mapreduce.job.maps</code> to a number greater than the number of regions. Maps
        will run on the adjacent TaskTracker if you are running a TaskTracer and RegionServer per
        node. When writing to HBase, it may make sense to avoid the Reduce step and write back into
        HBase from within your map. This approach works when your job does not need the sort and
        collation that MapReduce does on the map-emitted data. On insert, HBase 'sorts' so there is
        no point double-sorting (and shuffling data around your MapReduce cluster) unless you need
        to. If you do not need the Reduce, you myour map might emit counts of records processed for
        reporting at the end of the jobj, or set the number of Reduces to zero and use
        TableOutputFormat. If running the Reduce step makes sense in your case, you should typically
        use multiple reducers so that load is spread across the HBase cluster.</para>

      <para>A new HBase partitioner, the <link
          xlink:href="http://hbase.apache.org/apidocs/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/mapreduce/HRegionPartitioner.html">HRegionPartitioner</link>,
        can run as many reducers the number of existing regions. The HRegionPartitioner is suitable
        when your table is large and your upload will not greatly alter the number of existing
        regions upon completion. Otherwise use the default partitioner. </para>

      <title>Writing HFiles Directly During Bulk Import</title>
      <para>If you are importing into a new table, you can bypass the HBase API and write your

        will run faster, perhaps an order of magnitude faster. For more on how this mechanism works,

	  <title>NoSQL?</title>
	  <para>HBase is a type of "NoSQL" database.  "NoSQL" is a general term meaning that the database isn't an RDBMS which
	  supports SQL as its primary access language, but there are many types of NoSQL databases:  BerkeleyDB is an
	  example of a local NoSQL database, whereas HBase is very much a distributed database.  Technically speaking,
	  HBase is really more a "Data Store" than "Data Base" because it lacks many of the features you find in an RDBMS,
	  such as typed columns, secondary indexes, triggers, and advanced query languages, etc.
	  </para>
	  <para>However, HBase has many features which supports both linear and modular scaling.  HBase clusters expand
	  by adding RegionServers that are hosted on commodity class servers. If a cluster expands from 10 to 20
	  RegionServers, for example, it doubles both in terms of storage and as well as processing capacity.
	  RDBMS can scale well, but only up to a point - specifically, the size of a single database server - and for the best
	  performance requires specialized hardware and storage devices.  HBase features of note are:

	  <section xml:id="arch.overview.when">
	    <title>When Should I Use HBase?</title>
	    	  <para>HBase isn't suitable for every problem.</para>
	          <para>First, make sure you have enough data.  If you have hundreds of millions or billions of rows, then
	            HBase is a good candidate.  If you only have a few thousand/million rows, then using a traditional RDBMS
	            might be a better choice due to the fact that all of your data might wind up on a single node (or two) and
	            the rest of the cluster may be sitting idle.
	          </para>
	          <para>Second, make sure you can live without all the extra features that an RDBMS provides (e.g., typed columns,
	          secondary indexes, transactions, advanced query languages, etc.)  An application built against an RDBMS cannot be
	          "ported" to HBase by simply changing a JDBC driver, for example.  Consider moving from an RDBMS to HBase as a
	          complete redesign as opposed to a port.
              </para>
	          <para>Third, make sure you have enough hardware.  Even HDFS doesn't do well with anything less than
                5 DataNodes (due to things such as HDFS block replication which has a default of 3), plus a NameNode.
                </para>
                <para>HBase can run quite well stand-alone on a laptop - but this should be considered a development
                configuration only.

          Its documentation states that it is not, however, a general purpose file system, and does not provide fast individual record lookups in files.
          HBase, on the other hand, is built on top of HDFS and provides fast record lookups (and updates) for large tables.
          This can sometimes be a point of conceptual confusion.  HBase internally puts your data in indexed "StoreFiles" that exist
          on HDFS for high-speed lookups.  See the <xref linkend="datamodel" /> and the rest of this chapter for more information on how HBase achieves its goals.

        is responsible for finding RegionServers that are serving the particular row range of
        interest. It does this by querying the <code>hbase:meta</code> table. See <xref
          linkend="arch.catalog.meta" /> for details. After locating the required region(s), the
        client contacts the RegionServer serving that region, rather than going through the master,
        and issues the read or write request. This information is cached in the client so that
        subsequent requests need not go through the lookup process. Should a region be reassigned
        either by the master load balancer or because a RegionServer has died, the client will
        requery the catalog tables to determine the new location of the user region. </para>

        <para>A common dist-list question involves what happens to an HBase cluster when the Master

          RegionServer failover and completing region splits. So while the cluster can still run for
          a short time without the Master, the Master should be restarted as soon as possible.

        <para>HBase provides two different BlockCache implementations: the default onheap
          LruBlockCache and BucketCache, which is (usually) offheap. This section
          discusses benefits and drawbacks of each implementation, how to choose the appropriate
          option, and configuration options for each.</para>

      <para>See the RegionServer UI for detail on caching deploy.  Since HBase-0.98.4, the
          Block Cache detail has been significantly extended showing configurations,
          sizings, current usage, and even detail on block counts and types.</para>
  </note>

        <section>

          <title>Cache Choices</title>
          <para><classname>LruBlockCache</classname> is the original implementation, and is
              entirely within the Java heap. <classname>BucketCache</classname> is mainly
              intended for keeping blockcache data offheap, although BucketCache can also
              keep data onheap and serve from a file-backed cache.
          </para>

          <para>Fetching will always be slower when fetching from BucketCache,
              as compared to the native onheap LruBlockCache. However, latencies tend to be
              less erratic across time, because there is less garbage collection when you use
              BucketCache since it is managing BlockCache allocations, not the GC. If the
              BucketCache is deployed in offheap mode, this memory is not managed by the
              GC at all. This is why you'd use BucketCache, so your latencies are less erratic and to mitigate GCs
              and heap fragmentation.  See Nick Dimiduk's <link
              xlink:href="http://www.n10k.com/blog/blockcache-101/">BlockCache 101</link> for
            comparisons running onheap vs offheap tests. Also see
            <link xlink:href="http://people.apache.org/~stack/bc/">Comparing BlockCache Deploys</link>
            which finds that if your dataset fits inside your LruBlockCache deploy, use it otherwise
            if you are experiencing cache churn (or you want your cache to exist beyond the
            vagaries of java GC), use BucketCache.
              </para>

              <para>When you enable BucketCache, you are enabling a two tier caching
              system, an L1 cache which is implemented by an instance of LruBlockCache and
              an offheap L2 cache which is implemented by BucketCache.  Management of these
              two tiers and the policy that dictates how blocks move between them is done by
              <classname>CombinedBlockCache</classname>. It keeps all DATA blocks in the L2
              BucketCache and meta blocks -- INDEX and BLOOM blocks --
              onheap in the L1 <classname>LruBlockCache</classname>.

          <title>LruBlockCache Usage</title>
          <para>Block caching is enabled by default for all the user tables which means that any
            read operation will load the LRU cache. This might be good for a large number of use
            cases, but further tunings are usually required in order to achieve better performance.
            An important concept is the <link
              xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_set_size">working set size</link>, or
            WSS, which is: "the amount of memory needed to compute the answer to a problem". For a
            website, this would be the data that's needed to answer the queries over a short amount
            of time. </para>
          <para>The way to calculate how much memory is available in HBase for caching is: </para>
          <programlisting>
            number of region servers * heap size * hfile.block.cache.size * 0.85
        </programlisting>
          <para>The default value for the block cache is 0.25 which represents 25% of the available
            heap. The last value (85%) is the default acceptable loading factor in the LRU cache
            after which eviction is started. The reason it is included in this equation is that it
            would be unrealistic to say that it is possible to use 100% of the available memory
            since this would make the process blocking from the point where it loads new blocks.

                  of the block size (64KB by default), the size of your keys and the amount of data
                  you are storing. For big data sets it's not unusual to see numbers around 1GB per
                  region server, although not all of it will be in cache because the LRU will evict

          <para>Currently the recommended way to measure HFile indexes and bloom filters sizes is to
            look at the region server web UI and checkout the relevant metrics. For keys, sampling
            can be done by using the HFile command line tool and look for the average key size
            metric. Since HBase 0.98.3, you can view detail on BlockCache stats and metrics
            in a special Block Cache section in the UI.</para>
          <para>It's generally bad to use block caching when the WSS doesn't fit in memory. This is
            the case when you have for example 40GB available across all your region servers' block
            caches but you need to process 1TB of data. One of the reasons is that the churn
            generated by the evictions will trigger more garbage collections unnecessarily. Here are
            two use cases: </para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>Fully random reading pattern: This is a case where you almost never access the
                same row twice within a short amount of time such that the chance of hitting a
                cached block is close to 0. Setting block caching on such a table is a waste of
                memory and CPU cycles, more so that it will generate more garbage to pick up by the
                JVM. For more information on monitoring GC, see <xref

            <listitem>
              <para>Mapping a table: In a typical MapReduce job that takes a table in input, every
                row will be read only once so there's no need to put them into the block cache. The
                Scan object has the option of turning this off via the setCaching method (set it to
                false). You can still keep block caching turned on on this table if you need fast
                random read access. An example would be counting the number of rows in a table that
                serves live traffic, caching every block of that table would create massive churn
                and would surely evict data that's currently in use. </para>

            <title>How to Enable BucketCache</title>
                <para>The usual deploy of BucketCache is via a managing class that sets up two caching tiers: an L1 onheap cache
                    implemented by LruBlockCache and a second L2 cache implemented with BucketCache. The managing class is <link
                        xlink:href="http://hbase.apache.org/devapidocs/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/io/hfile/CombinedBlockCache.html">CombinedBlockCache</link> by default.
            The just-previous link describes the caching 'policy' implemented by CombinedBlockCache. In short, it works
            by keeping meta blocks -- INDEX and BLOOM in the L1, onheap LruBlockCache tier -- and DATA
            blocks are kept in the L2, BucketCache tier. It is possible to amend this behavior in
            HBase since version 1.0 and ask that a column family have both its meta and DATA blocks hosted onheap in the L1 tier by
            setting <varname>cacheDataInL1</varname> via
                  <code>(HColumnDescriptor.setCacheDataInL1(true)</code>
            or in the shell, creating or amending column families setting <varname>CACHE_DATA_IN_L1</varname>
            to true: e.g. <programlisting>hbase(main):003:0> create 't', {NAME => 't', CONFIGURATION => {CACHE_DATA_IN_L1 => 'true'}}</programlisting></para>

        <para>The BucketCache Block Cache can be deployed onheap, offheap, or file based.
            You set which via the
            <varname>hbase.bucketcache.ioengine</varname> setting.  Setting it to
            <varname>heap</varname> will have BucketCache deployed inside the 
            allocated java heap. Setting it to <varname>offheap</varname> will have
            BucketCache make its allocations offheap,
            and an ioengine setting of <varname>file:PATH_TO_FILE</varname> will direct
            BucketCache to use a file caching (Useful in particular if you have some fast i/o attached to the box such
            as SSDs).

        <para xml:id="raw.l1.l2">It is possible to deploy an L1+L2 setup where we bypass the CombinedBlockCache

              <literal>false</literal>. In this mode, on eviction from L1, blocks go to L2.
              When a block is cached, it is cached first in L1. When we go to look for a cached block,

              <para>This sample provides a configuration for a 4 GB offheap BucketCache with a 1 GB
                  onheap cache. Configuration is performed on the RegionServer.  Setting
                  <varname>hbase.bucketcache.ioengine</varname> and 
                  <varname>hbase.bucketcache.size</varname> &gt; 0 enables CombinedBlockCache.
                  Let us presume that the RegionServer has been set to run with a 5G heap:
                  i.e. HBASE_HEAPSIZE=5g.
              </para>
              <step>
                <para>First, edit the RegionServer's <filename>hbase-env.sh</filename> and set
                  <varname>-XX:MaxDirectMemorySize</varname> to a value greater than the offheap size wanted, in
                  this case, 4 GB (expressed as 4G).  Lets set it to 5G.  That'll be 4G
                  for our offheap cache and 1G for any other uses of offheap memory (there are
                  other users of offheap memory other than BlockCache; e.g. DFSClient 
                  in RegionServer can make use of offheap memory). See <xref linkend="direct.memory" />.</para>

                In other words, you configure the L1 LruBlockCache as you would normally,

                <title>Direct Memory Usage In HBase</title>
                <para>The default maximum direct memory varies by JVM.  Traditionally it is 64M
                    or some relation to allocated heap size (-Xmx) or no limit at all (JDK7 apparently).
                    HBase servers use direct memory, in particular short-circuit reading, the hosted DFSClient will
                    allocate direct memory buffers.  If you do offheap block caching, you'll
                    be making use of direct memory.  Starting your JVM, make sure
                    the <varname>-XX:MaxDirectMemorySize</varname> setting in
                    <filename>conf/hbase-env.sh</filename> is set to some value that is
                    higher than what you have allocated to your offheap blockcache
                    (<varname>hbase.bucketcache.size</varname>).  It should be larger than your offheap block
                    cache and then some for DFSClient usage (How much the DFSClient uses is not
                    easy to quantify; it is the number of open hfiles * <varname>hbase.dfs.client.read.shortcircuit.buffer.size</varname>
                    where hbase.dfs.client.read.shortcircuit.buffer.size is set to 128k in HBase -- see <filename>hbase-default.xml</filename>
                    default configurations).
                        Direct memory, which is part of the Java process heap, is separate from the object
                        heap allocated by -Xmx. The value allocated by MaxDirectMemorySize must not exceed
                        physical RAM, and is likely to be less than the total available RAM due to other
                        memory requirements and system constraints.
                </para>
                <para>You can see how much memory -- onheap and offheap/direct -- a RegionServer is configured to use
                    and how much it is using at any one time by looking at the
                    <emphasis>Server Metrics: Memory</emphasis> tab in the UI.
                    It can also be gotten via JMX.  In particular the direct
                    memory currently used by the server can be found on the

                  <para>This is a pre-HBase 1.0 configuration removed because it
                      was confusing. It was a float that you would set to some value
                      between 0.0 and 1.0.  Its default was 0.9. If the deploy was using
                      CombinedBlockCache, then the LruBlockCache L1 size was calculated to

                      is set as a fraction of java heap using hfile.block.cache.size setting
                      (not the best name) and L2 is set as above either in absolute

          <para>The <firstterm>Write Ahead Log (WAL)</firstterm> records all changes to data in
            HBase, to file-based storage. Under normal operations, the WAL is not needed because
            data changes move from the MemStore to StoreFiles. However, if a RegionServer crashes or
          becomes unavailable before the MemStore is flushed, the WAL ensures that the changes to
          the data can be replayed. If writing to the WAL fails, the entire operation to modify the

          <title>WAL Splitting</title>

          <para>A RegionServer serves many regions. All of the regions in a region server share the
            same active WAL file. Each edit in the WAL file includes information about which region
            it belongs to. When a region is opened, the edits in the WAL file which belong to that
            region need to be replayed. Therefore, edits in the WAL file must be grouped by region
            so that particular sets can be replayed to regenerate the data in a particular region.
            The process of grouping the WAL edits by region is called <firstterm>log
              splitting</firstterm>. It is a critical process for recovering data if a region server
            fails.</para>
          <para>Log splitting is done by the HMaster during cluster start-up or by the ServerShutdownHandler
            as a region server shuts down. So that consistency is guaranteed, affected regions
            are unavailable until data is restored. All WAL edits need to be recovered and replayed
            before a given region can become available again. As a result, regions affected by
            log splitting are unavailable until the process completes.</para>

              <para>Renaming the directory is important because a RegionServer may still be up and
                accepting requests even if the HMaster thinks it is down. If the RegionServer does
                not respond immediately and does not heartbeat its ZooKeeper session, the HMaster
                may interpret this as a RegionServer failure. Renaming the logs directory ensures
                that existing, valid WAL files which are still in use by an active but busy

                          1000 regions that have 2 families each is 3.9GB of heap used, and it's not even storing data yet. NB: the 2MB value is configurable.

                          flushes when you have too many regions which in turn generates compactions.
                          Rewriting the same data tens of times is the last thing you want.
                          An example is filling 1000 regions (with one family) equally and let's consider a lower bound for global memstore
                          usage of 5GB (the region server would have a big heap).
                          Once it reaches 5GB it will force flush the biggest region,
                          at that point they should almost all have about 5MB of data so
                          it would flush that amount. 5MB inserted later, it would flush another
                          region that will now have a bit over 5MB of data, and so on.
                          This is currently the main limiting factor for the number of regions; see <xref linkend="ops.capacity.regions.count" />

          Thus, HBase eventually achieves locality for a region after a flush or a compaction.
          In a RegionServer failover situation a RegionServer may be assigned regions with non-local
          StoreFiles (because none of the replicas are local), however as new data is written
          in the region, or the table is compacted and StoreFiles are re-written, they will become "local"
          to the RegionServer.

        send merge request to this regionserver and regionserver run the region merges.
        Similar with process of region splits, region merges run as a local transaction
        on the regionserver, offlines the regions and then merges two regions on the file
        system, atomically delete merging regions from META and add merged region to the META,
        opens merged region on the regionserver and reports the merge to Master at last.

              <firstterm>Compaction</firstterm> is an operation which reduces the number of
            StoreFiles in a Store, by merging them together, in order to increase performance on

          <para>Compactions fall into two categories: minor and major. Minor and major compactions
            differ in the following ways.</para>
          <para><firstterm>Minor compactions</firstterm> usually select a small number of small,
            adjacent StoreFiles and rewrite them as a single StoreFile. Minor compactions do not
            drop (filter out) deletes or expired versions, because of potential side effects. See <xref
              linkend="compaction.and.deletes" /> and <xref
              linkend="compaction.and.versions" /> for information on how deletes and versions are
            handled in relation to compactions. The end result of a minor compaction is fewer,
            larger StoreFiles for a given Store.</para>
          <para>The end result of a <firstterm>major compaction</firstterm> is a single StoreFile
            per Store. Major compactions also process delete markers and max versions. See <xref

              the deletion happens because of an expired TTL, no tombstone is created. Instead, the

          <para>In theory, major compactions improve performance. However, on a highly loaded
            system, major compactions can require an inappropriate number of resources and adversely
            affect performance. In a default configuration, major compactions are scheduled
            automatically to run once in a 7-day period. This is sometimes inappropriate for systems
            in production. You can manage major compactions manually. See <xref
              linkend="managed.compactions" />. </para>

            <para>Compacting large StoreFiles, or too many StoreFiles at once, can cause more IO
              load than your cluster is able to handle without causing performance problems. The
              method by which HBase selects which StoreFiles to include in a compaction (and whether
              the compaction is a minor or major compaction) is called the <firstterm>compaction
                policy</firstterm>.</para>
            <para>Prior to HBase 0.96.x, there was only one compaction policy. That original
              compaction policy is still available as
                <systemitem>RatioBasedCompactionPolicy</systemitem> The new compaction default
              policy, called <systemitem>ExploringCompactionPolicy</systemitem>, was subsequently
              backported to HBase 0.94 and HBase 0.95, and is the default in HBase 0.96 and newer.
              It was implemented in <link
                xlink:href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-7842">HBASE-7842</link>. In
              short, <systemitem>ExploringCompactionPolicy</systemitem> attempts to select the best

                <systemitem>RatioBasedCompactionPolicy</systemitem> selects the first set that meets
              the criteria.</para>
            <para>Regardless of the compaction policy used, file selection is controlled by several

              <title>Being Stuck</title>
              <para>When the MemStore gets too large, it needs to flush its contents to a StoreFile.
                However, a Store can only have <varname>hbase.hstore.blockingStoreFiles</varname>
                files, so the MemStore needs to wait for the number of StoreFiles to be reduced by
                one or more compactions. However, if the MemStore grows larger than
                  <varname>hbase.hregion.memstore.flush.size</varname>, it is not able to flush its
                contents to a StoreFile. If the MemStore is too large and the number of StpreFo;es
                is also too high, the algorithm is said to be "stuck". The compaction algorithm
                checks for this "stuck" situation and provides mechanisms to alleviate it.</para>

              <title>The ExploringCompactionPolicy Algorithm</title>
              <para>The ExploringCompactionPolicy algorithm considers each possible set of
                adjacent StoreFiles before choosing the set where compaction will have the most
                benefit. </para>
              <para>One situation where the ExploringCompactionPolicy works especially well is when
                you are bulk-loading data and the bulk loads create larger StoreFiles than the
                StoreFiles which are holding data older than the bulk-loaded data. This can "trick"
                HBase into choosing to perform a major compaction each time a compaction is needed,
                and cause a lot of extra overhead. With the ExploringCompactionPolicy, major
                compactions happen much less frequently because minor compactions are more
                efficient.</para>
              <para>In general, ExploringCompactionPolicy is the right choice for most situations,
                and thus is the default compaction policy. You can also use
                ExploringCompactionPolicy along with <xref

            <title>Experimental: Stripe Compactions</title>
            <para> Stripe compactions is an experimental feature added in HBase 0.98 which aims to
              improve compactions for large regions or non-uniformly distributed row keys. In order
              to achieve smaller and/or more granular compactions, the StoreFiles within a region
              are maintained separately for several row-key sub-ranges, or "stripes", of the region.
              The stripes are transparent to the rest of HBase, so other operations on the HFiles or
              data work without modification.</para>
            <para>Stripe compactions change the HFile layout, creating sub-regions within regions.
              These sub-regions are easier to compact, and should result in fewer major compactions.
              This approach alleviates some of the challenges of larger regions.</para>
            <para>Stripe compaction is fully compatible with <xref
                linkend="compaction" /> and works in conjunction with either the
              ExploringCompactionPolicy or RatioBasedCompactionPolicy. It can be enabled for
              existing tables, and the table will continue to operate normally if it is disabled
              later. </para>

              <para>Performance testing has shown that the performance of reads improves somewhat,
                and variability of performance of reads and writes is greatly reduced. An overall
                long-term performance improvement is seen on large non-uniform-row key regions, such
                as a hash-prefixed timestamp key. These performance gains are the most dramatic on a
                table which is already large. It is possible that the performance improvement might

      <section xml:id="arch.bulk.load.overview"><title>Overview</title>
      <para>
        HBase includes several methods of loading data into tables.
        The most straightforward method is to either use the <code>TableOutputFormat</code>
        class from a MapReduce job, or use the normal client APIs; however,
        these are not always the most efficient methods.
      </para>
      <para>
        The bulk load feature uses a MapReduce job to output table data in HBase's internal
        data format, and then directly loads the generated StoreFiles into a running
        cluster. Using bulk load will use less CPU and network resources than
        simply using the HBase API.
      </para>
    </section>
    <section xml:id="arch.bulk.load.limitations"><title>Bulk Load Limitations</title>
        <para>As bulk loading bypasses the write path, the WAL doesn’t get written to as part of the process.
            Replication works by reading the WAL files so it won’t see the bulk loaded data – and the same goes for the edits that use Put.setWriteToWAL(true).
            One way to handle that is to ship the raw files or the HFiles to the other cluster and do the other processing there.</para>
    </section>
    <section xml:id="arch.bulk.load.arch"><title>Bulk Load Architecture</title>
      <para>
        The HBase bulk load process consists of two main steps.
      </para>
      <section xml:id="arch.bulk.load.prep"><title>Preparing data via a MapReduce job</title>
        <para>
          The first step of a bulk load is to generate HBase data files (StoreFiles) from
          a MapReduce job using <code>HFileOutputFormat</code>. This output format writes
          out data in HBase's internal storage format so that they can be
          later loaded very efficiently into the cluster.
        </para>
        <para>
          In order to function efficiently, <code>HFileOutputFormat</code> must be
          configured such that each output HFile fits within a single region.
          In order to do this, jobs whose output will be bulk loaded into HBase
          use Hadoop's <code>TotalOrderPartitioner</code> class to partition the map output
          into disjoint ranges of the key space, corresponding to the key
          ranges of the regions in the table.
        </para>
        <para>
          <code>HFileOutputFormat</code> includes a convenience function,
          <code>configureIncrementalLoad()</code>, which automatically sets up
          a <code>TotalOrderPartitioner</code> based on the current region boundaries of a
          table.
        </para>
      </section>
      <section xml:id="arch.bulk.load.complete"><title>Completing the data load</title>
        <para>
          After the data has been prepared using
          <code>HFileOutputFormat</code>, it is loaded into the cluster using
          <code>completebulkload</code>. This command line tool iterates
          through the prepared data files, and for each one determines the
          region the file belongs to. It then contacts the appropriate Region
          Server which adopts the HFile, moving it into its storage directory
          and making the data available to clients.
        </para>
        <para>
          If the region boundaries have changed during the course of bulk load
          preparation, or between the preparation and completion steps, the
          <code>completebulkloads</code> utility will automatically split the
          data files into pieces corresponding to the new boundaries. This
          process is not optimally efficient, so users should take care to
          minimize the delay between preparing a bulk load and importing it
          into the cluster, especially if other clients are simultaneously
          loading data through other means.
        </para>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section xml:id="arch.bulk.load.import"><title>Importing the prepared data using the completebulkload tool</title>
      <para>
        After a data import has been prepared, either by using the
        <code>importtsv</code> tool with the
        "<code>importtsv.bulk.output</code>" option or by some other MapReduce
        job using the <code>HFileOutputFormat</code>, the
        <code>completebulkload</code> tool is used to import the data into the
        running cluster.
      </para>
      <para>
        The <code>completebulkload</code> tool simply takes the output path
        where <code>importtsv</code> or your MapReduce job put its results, and
        the table name to import into. For example:
      </para>
      <screen language="bourne">$ hadoop jar hbase-VERSION.jar completebulkload [-c /path/to/hbase/config/hbase-site.xml] /user/todd/myoutput mytable</screen>
      <para>
        The <code>-c config-file</code> option can be used to specify a file
        containing the appropriate hbase parameters (e.g., hbase-site.xml) if
        not supplied already on the CLASSPATH (In addition, the CLASSPATH must
        contain the directory that has the zookeeper configuration file if
        zookeeper is NOT managed by HBase).
      </para>
      <para>
        Note: If the target table does not already exist in HBase, this
        tool will create the table automatically.</para>
      <para>
        This tool will run quickly, after which point the new data will be visible in
        the cluster.

			<section xml:id="casestudies.timelineconsistent.intro">
		      <title>Introduction</title>
		      <para> 
			HBase, architecturally, always had the strong consistency guarantee from the start. All reads and writes are routed through a single region server, which guarantees that all writes happen in an order, and all reads are seeing the most recent committed data. 
	          </para><para>
			However, because of this single homing of the reads to a single location, if the server becomes unavailable, the regions of the table that were hosted in the region server become unavailable for some time. There are three phases in the region recovery process - detection, assignment, and recovery. Of these, the detection is usually the longest and is presently in the order of 20-30 seconds depending on the zookeeper session timeout. During this time and before the recovery is complete, the clients will not be able to read the region data.
	          </para><para>
			However, for some use cases, either the data may be read-only, or doing reads againsts some stale data is acceptable. With timeline-consistent high available reads, HBase can be used for these kind of latency-sensitive use cases where the application can expect to have a time bound on the read completion. 
	          </para><para>
			For achieving high availability for reads, HBase provides a feature called “region replication”. In this model, for each region of a table, there will be multiple replicas that are opened in different region servers. By default, the region replication is set to 1, so only a single region replica is deployed and there will not be any changes from the original model. If region replication is set to 2 or more, than the master will assign replicas of the regions of the table. The Load Balancer ensures that the region replicas are not co-hosted in the same region servers and also in the same rack (if possible). 
	          </para><para>
			All of the replicas for a single region will have a unique replica_id, starting from 0. The region replica having replica_id==0 is called the primary region, and the others “secondary regions” or secondaries. Only the primary can accept writes from the client, and the primary will always contain the latest changes. Since all writes still have to go through the primary region, the writes are not highly-available (meaning they might block for some time if the region becomes unavailable). 
	          </para><para>
			The writes are asynchronously sent to the secondary region replicas using an “Async WAL replication” feature. This works similarly to HBase’s multi-datacenter replication, but instead the data from a region is replicated to the secondary regions. Each secondary replica always receives and observes the writes in the same order that the primary region committed them. This ensures that the secondaries won’t diverge from the primary regions data, but since the log replication is asnyc, the data might be stale in secondary regions. In some sense, this design can be thought of as “in-cluster replication”, where instead of replicating to a different datacenter, the data goes to a secondary region to keep secondary region’s in-memory state up to date. The data files are shared between the primary region and the other replicas, so that there is no extra storage overhead. However, the secondary regions will have recent non-flushed data in their memstores, which increases the memory overhead. 
	         </para><para>
	Async WAL replication feature is being implemented in Phase 2 of issue HBASE-10070. Before this, region replicas will only be updated with flushed data files from the primary (see hbase.regionserver.storefile.refresh.period below). It is also possible to use this without setting storefile.refresh.period for read only tables.

	         <para>
			With this feature, HBase introduces a Consistency definition, which can be provided per read operation (get or scan).
	<programlisting language="java">
public enum Consistency {
    STRONG,
    TIMELINE
}
	</programlisting>
			<code>Consistency.STRONG</code> is the default consistency model provided by HBase. In case the table has region replication = 1, or in a table with region replicas but the reads are done with this consistency, the read is always performed by the primary regions, so that there will not be any change from the previous behaviour, and the client always observes the latest data. 
	          </para><para>
			In case a read is performed with <code>Consistency.TIMELINE</code>, then the read RPC will be sent to the primary region server first. After a short interval (<code>hbase.client.primaryCallTimeout.get</code>, 10ms by default), parallel RPC for secondary region replicas will also be sent if the primary does not respond back. After this, the result is returned from whichever RPC is finished first. If the response came back from the primary region replica, we can always know that the data is latest. For this Result.isStale() API has been added to inspect the staleness. If the result is from a secondary region, then Result.isStale() will be set to true. The user can then inspect this field to possibly reason about the data. 
	          </para><para>
			In terms of semantics, TIMELINE consistency as implemented by HBase differs from pure eventual
			consistency in these respects: </para>

              <para> Single homed and ordered updates: Region replication or not, on the write side,
                there is still only 1 defined replica (primary) which can accept writes. This
                replica is responsible for ordering the edits and preventing conflicts. This
                guarantees that two different writes are not committed at the same time by different
                replicas and the data diverges. With this, there is no need to do read-repair or

                multi-datacenter replication, however in a single cluster. </para>

                required, this can be implemented later though. </para>

		<para>
			To better understand the TIMELINE semantics, lets look at the above diagram. Lets say that there are two clients, and the first one writes x=1 at first, then x=2 and x=3 later. As above, all writes are handled by the primary region replica. The writes are saved in the write ahead log (WAL), and replicated to the other replicas asynchronously. In the above diagram, notice that replica_id=1 received 2 updates, and it’s data shows that x=2, while the replica_id=2 only received a single update, and its data shows that x=1. 
		</para><para>
			If client1 reads with STRONG consistency, it will only talk with the replica_id=0, and thus is guaranteed to observe the latest value of x=3. In case of a client issuing TIMELINE consistency reads, the RPC will go to all replicas (after primary timeout) and the result from the first response will be returned back. Thus the client can see either 1, 2 or 3 as the value of x. Let’s say that the primary region has failed and log replication cannot continue for some time. If the client does multiple reads with TIMELINE consistency, she can observe x=2 first, then x=1, and so on.

        <para>To serve the region data from multiple replicas, HBase opens the regions in secondary
          mode in the region servers. The regions opened in secondary mode will share the same data
          files with the primary region replica, however each secondary region replica will have its
          own memstore to keep the unflushed data (only primary region can do flushes). Also to
          serve reads from secondary regions, the blocks of data files may be also cached in the
          block caches for the secondary regions. </para>

		<section>
			<title>Configuration properties</title>
			<para>
	To use highly available reads, you should set the following properties in hbase-site.xml file. There is no specific configuration to enable or disable region replicas. Instead you can change the number of region replicas per table to increase or decrease at the table creation or with alter table.

			<programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[
<property>
    <name>hbase.regionserver.storefile.refresh.period</name>
    <value>0</value>
    <description>
      The period (in milliseconds) for refreshing the store files for the secondary regions. 0 means this feature is disabled. Secondary regions sees new files (from flushes and compactions) from primary once the secondary region refreshes the list of files in the region. But too frequent refreshes might cause extra Namenode pressure. If the files cannot be refreshed for longer than HFile TTL (hbase.master.hfilecleaner.ttl) the requests are rejected. Configuring HFile TTL to a larger value is also recommended with this setting.

]]></programlisting>

          <para> One thing to keep in mind also is that, region replica placement policy is only
            enforced by the <code>StochasticLoadBalancer</code> which is the default balancer. If
            you are using a custom load balancer property in hbase-site.xml
              (<code>hbase.master.loadbalancer.class</code>) replicas of regions might end up being
            hosted in the same server.</para>

    <title>hbck In Depth</title>
	<para>HBaseFsck (hbck) is a tool for checking for region consistency and table integrity problems
and repairing a corrupted HBase. It works in two basic modes -- a read-only inconsistency
identifying mode and a multi-phase read-write repair mode.
	</para>
	<section>
	  <title>Running hbck to identify inconsistencies</title>
<para>To check to see if your HBase cluster has corruptions, run hbck against your HBase cluster:</para>
<programlisting language="bourne">
$ ./bin/hbase hbck
</programlisting>
	<para>
At the end of the commands output it prints OK or tells you the number of INCONSISTENCIES
present. You may also want to run run hbck a few times because some inconsistencies can be
transient (e.g. cluster is starting up or a region is splitting). Operationally you may want to run
hbck regularly and setup alert (e.g. via nagios) if it repeatedly reports inconsistencies .
A run of hbck will report a list of inconsistencies along with a brief description of the regions and
tables affected. The using the <code>-details</code> option will report more details including a representative
listing of all the splits present in all the tables.
	</para>
<programlisting language="bourne">
$ ./bin/hbase hbck -details
</programlisting>
<para>If you just want to know if some tables are corrupted, you can limit hbck to identify inconsistencies
in only specific tables. For example the following command would only attempt to check table
TableFoo and TableBar. The benefit is that hbck will run in less time.</para>
<programlisting language="bourne">
$ ./bin/hbase hbck TableFoo TableBar
</programlisting>
	</section>
	<section><title>Inconsistencies</title>
	<para>
	If after several runs, inconsistencies continue to be reported, you may have encountered a
corruption. These should be rare, but in the event they occur newer versions of HBase include
the hbck tool enabled with automatic repair options.
	</para>
	<para>
	There are two invariants that when violated create inconsistencies in HBase:
	</para>
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem><para>HBase’s region consistency invariant is satisfied if every region is assigned and
deployed on exactly one region server, and all places where this state kept is in
accordance.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem><para>HBase’s table integrity invariant is satisfied if for each table, every possible row key
resolves to exactly one region.</para>
	</listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
	<para>
Repairs generally work in three phases -- a read-only information gathering phase that identifies
inconsistencies, a table integrity repair phase that restores the table integrity invariant, and then
finally a region consistency repair phase that restores the region consistency invariant.
Starting from version 0.90.0, hbck could detect region consistency problems report on a subset
of possible table integrity problems. It also included the ability to automatically fix the most
common inconsistency, region assignment and deployment consistency problems. This repair
could be done by using the <code>-fix</code> command line option. These problems close regions if they are
open on the wrong server or on multiple region servers and also assigns regions to region
servers if they are not open.
</para>
<para>
Starting from HBase versions 0.90.7, 0.92.2 and 0.94.0, several new command line options are
introduced to aid repairing a corrupted HBase. This hbck sometimes goes by the nickname
“uberhbck”. Each particular version of uber hbck is compatible with the HBase’s of the same
major version (0.90.7 uberhbck can repair a 0.90.4). However, versions &lt;=0.90.6 and versions
&lt;=0.92.1 may require restarting the master or failing over to a backup master.
</para>
	</section>
	<section><title>Localized repairs</title>
	<para>
	When repairing a corrupted HBase, it is best to repair the lowest risk inconsistencies first.
These are generally region consistency repairs -- localized single region repairs, that only modify
in-memory data, ephemeral zookeeper data, or patch holes in the META table.
Region consistency requires that the HBase instance has the state of the region’s data in HDFS
(.regioninfo files), the region’s row in the hbase:meta table., and region’s deployment/assignments on
region servers and the master in accordance. Options for repairing region consistency include:
	<itemizedlist>
		<listitem><para><code>-fixAssignments</code> (equivalent to the 0.90 <code>-fix</code> option) repairs unassigned, incorrectly
assigned or multiply assigned regions.</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem><para><code>-fixMeta</code> which removes meta rows when corresponding regions are not present in
		  HDFS and adds new meta rows if they regions are present in HDFS while not in META.</para>
		</listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
	To fix deployment and assignment problems you can run this command:
</para>
<programlisting language="bourne">
$ ./bin/hbase hbck -fixAssignments
</programlisting>
<para>To fix deployment and assignment problems as well as repairing incorrect meta rows you can
run this command:</para>
<programlisting language="bourne">
$ ./bin/hbase hbck -fixAssignments -fixMeta
</programlisting>
<para>There are a few classes of table integrity problems that are low risk repairs. The first two are
degenerate (startkey == endkey) regions and backwards regions (startkey > endkey). These are
automatically handled by sidelining the data to a temporary directory (/hbck/xxxx).
The third low-risk class is hdfs region holes. This can be repaired by using the:</para>
	<itemizedlist>
		<listitem><para><code>-fixHdfsHoles</code> option for fabricating new empty regions on the file system.
If holes are detected you can use -fixHdfsHoles and should include -fixMeta and -fixAssignments to make the new region consistent.</para>
		</listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
<programlisting language="bourne">
$ ./bin/hbase hbck -fixAssignments -fixMeta -fixHdfsHoles
</programlisting>
<para>Since this is a common operation, we’ve added a the <code>-repairHoles</code> flag that is equivalent to the
previous command:</para>
<programlisting language="bourne">
$ ./bin/hbase hbck -repairHoles
</programlisting>
<para>If inconsistencies still remain after these steps, you most likely have table integrity problems
related to orphaned or overlapping regions.</para>
	</section>
	<section><title>Region Overlap Repairs</title>
<para>Table integrity problems can require repairs that deal with overlaps. This is a riskier operation
because it requires modifications to the file system, requires some decision making, and may
require some manual steps. For these repairs it is best to analyze the output of a <code>hbck -details</code>
run so that you isolate repairs attempts only upon problems the checks identify. Because this is
riskier, there are safeguard that should be used to limit the scope of the repairs.
WARNING: This is a relatively new and have only been tested on online but idle HBase instances
(no reads/writes). Use at your own risk in an active production environment!
The options for repairing table integrity violations include:</para>
	<itemizedlist>
		<listitem><para><code>-fixHdfsOrphans</code> option for “adopting” a region directory that is missing a region
metadata file (the .regioninfo file).</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem><para><code>-fixHdfsOverlaps</code> ability for fixing overlapping regions</para>
		</listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
<para>When repairing overlapping regions, a region’s data can be modified on the file system in two
ways: 1) by merging regions into a larger region or 2) by sidelining regions by moving data to
“sideline” directory where data could be restored later. Merging a large number of regions is
technically correct but could result in an extremely large region that requires series of costly
compactions and splitting operations. In these cases, it is probably better to sideline the regions
that overlap with the most other regions (likely the largest ranges) so that merges can happen on
a more reasonable scale. Since these sidelined regions are already laid out in HBase’s native
directory and HFile format, they can be restored by using HBase’s bulk load mechanism.
The default safeguard thresholds are conservative. These options let you override the default
thresholds and to enable the large region sidelining feature.</para>
	<itemizedlist>
		<listitem><para><code>-maxMerge &lt;n&gt;</code> maximum number of overlapping regions to merge</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem><para><code>-sidelineBigOverlaps</code> if more than maxMerge regions are overlapping, sideline attempt
to sideline the regions overlapping with the most other regions.</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem><para><code>-maxOverlapsToSideline &lt;n&gt;</code> if sidelining large overlapping regions, sideline at most n
regions.</para>
		</listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

<para>Since often times you would just want to get the tables repaired, you can use this option to turn
on all repair options:</para>
	<itemizedlist>
		<listitem><para><code>-repair</code> includes all the region consistency options and only the hole repairing table
integrity options.</para>
		</listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
<para>Finally, there are safeguards to limit repairs to only specific tables. For example the following
command would only attempt to check and repair table TableFoo and TableBar.</para>
<screen language="bourne">
$ ./bin/hbase hbck -repair TableFoo TableBar
</screen>
	<section><title>Special cases: Meta is not properly assigned</title>
<para>There are a few special cases that hbck can handle as well.
Sometimes the meta table’s only region is inconsistently assigned or deployed. In this case
there is a special <code>-fixMetaOnly</code> option that can try to fix meta assignments.</para>
<screen language="bourne">
$ ./bin/hbase hbck -fixMetaOnly -fixAssignments
</screen>
	</section>
	<section><title>Special cases: HBase version file is missing</title>
<para>HBase’s data on the file system requires a version file in order to start. If this flie is missing, you
can use the <code>-fixVersionFile</code> option to fabricating a new HBase version file. This assumes that
the version of hbck you are running is the appropriate version for the HBase cluster.</para>
	</section>
	<section><title>Special case: Root and META are corrupt.</title>
<para>The most drastic corruption scenario is the case where the ROOT or META is corrupted and
HBase will not start. In this case you can use the OfflineMetaRepair tool create new ROOT
and META regions and tables.
This tool assumes that HBase is offline. It then marches through the existing HBase home
directory, loads as much information from region metadata files (.regioninfo files) as possible
from the file system. If the region metadata has proper table integrity, it sidelines the original root
and meta table directories, and builds new ones with pointers to the region directories and their
data.</para>
<screen language="bourne">
$ ./bin/hbase org.apache.hadoop.hbase.util.hbck.OfflineMetaRepair
</screen>
<para>NOTE: This tool is not as clever as uberhbck but can be used to bootstrap repairs that uberhbck
can complete.
If the tool succeeds you should be able to start hbase and run online repairs if necessary.</para>
	</section>
	<section><title>Special cases: Offline split parent</title>
    <para>
Once a region is split, the offline parent will be cleaned up automatically. Sometimes, daughter regions
are split again before their parents are cleaned up. HBase can clean up parents in the right order. However,
there could be some lingering offline split parents sometimes. They are in META, in HDFS, and not deployed.
But HBase can't clean them up. In this case, you can use the <code>-fixSplitParents</code> option to reset
them in META to be online and not split. Therefore, hbck can merge them with other regions if fixing
overlapping regions option is used.
    </para>
    <para>
This option should not normally be used, and it is not in <code>-fixAll</code>.

    <para>Some of the information in this section is pulled from a <link

      HBase Development mailing list.</para>
    <para>HBase supports several different compression algorithms which can be enabled on a
      ColumnFamily. Data block encoding attempts to limit duplication of information in keys, taking
      advantage of some of the fundamental designs and patterns of HBase, such as sorted row keys
      and the schema of a given table. Compressors reduce the size of large, opaque byte arrays in
      cells, and can significantly reduce the storage space needed to store uncompressed
      data.</para>
    <para>Compressors and data block encoding can be used together on the same ColumnFamily.</para>
    
    <formalpara>
      <title>Changes Take Effect Upon Compaction</title>
      <para>If you change compression or encoding for a ColumnFamily, the changes take effect during
       compaction.</para>
    </formalpara>

    <para>Some codecs take advantage of capabilities built into Java, such as GZip compression.
      Others rely on native libraries. Native libraries may be available as part of Hadoop, such as
      LZ4. In this case, HBase only needs access to the appropriate shared library. Other codecs,
      such as Google Snappy, need to be installed first. Some codecs are licensed in ways that
      conflict with HBase's license and cannot be shipped as part of HBase.</para>

    <para>This section discusses common codecs that are used and tested with HBase. No matter what
      codec you use, be sure to test that it is installed correctly and is available on all nodes in
      your cluster. Extra operational steps may be necessary to be sure that codecs are available on
      newly-deployed nodes. You can use the <xref
        linkend="compression.test" /> utility to check that a given codec is correctly
      installed.</para>

        <para>Prefix - Often, keys are very similar. Specifically, keys often share a common prefix
          and only differ near the end. For instance, one key might be
            <literal>RowKey:Family:Qualifier0</literal> and the next key might be
            <literal>RowKey:Family:Qualifier1</literal>. In Prefix encoding, an extra column is
          added which holds the length of the prefix shared between the current key and the previous
          key. Assuming the first key here is totally different from the key before, its prefix
          length is 0. The second key's prefix length is <literal>23</literal>, since they have the
          first 23 characters in common.</para>

        <para>Diff - Diff encoding expands upon Prefix encoding. Instead of considering the key
          sequentially as a monolithic series of bytes, each key field is split so that each part of
          the key can be compressed more efficiently. Two new fields are added: timestamp and type.
          If the ColumnFamily is the same as the previous row, it is omitted from the current row.
          If the key length, value length or type are the same as the previous row, the field is
          omitted. In addition, for increased compression, the timestamp is stored as a Diff from
          the previous row's timestamp, rather than being stored in full. Given the two row keys in
          the Prefix example, and given an exact match on timestamp and the same type, neither the
          value length, or type needs to be stored for the second row, and the timestamp value for
          the second row is just 0, rather than a full timestamp.</para>

          data is cached.</para>

        <para>Fast Diff - Fast Diff works similar to Diff, but uses a faster implementation. It also
          adds another field which stores a single bit to track whether the data itself is the same
          as the previous row. If it is, the data is not stored again. Fast Diff is the recommended
          codec to use if you have long keys or many columns. The data format is nearly identical to
        Diff encoding, so there is not an image to illustrate it.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Prefix Tree encoding was introduced as an experimental feature in HBase 0.96. It
          provides similar memory savings to the Prefix, Diff, and Fast Diff encoder, but provides
          faster random access at a cost of slower encoding speed. Prefix Tree may be appropriate
          for applications that have high block cache hit ratios. It introduces new 'tree' fields
          for the row and column. The row tree field contains a list of offsets/references
          corresponding to the cells in that row. This allows for a good deal of compression. For
          more details about Prefix Tree encoding, see <link
            xlink:href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-4676">HBASE-4676</link>. It is
          difficult to graphically illustrate a prefix tree, so no image is included. See the
          Wikipedia article for <link

      <title>Which Compressor or Data Block Encoder To Use</title>
      <para>The compression or codec type to use depends on the characteristics of your data.
        Choosing the wrong type could cause your data to take more space rather than less, and can

   <title>HFile format version 2</title>

   <section><title>Motivation </title>
   <para>Note:  this feature was introduced in HBase 0.92</para>
   <para>We found it necessary to revise the HFile format after encountering high memory usage and slow startup times caused by large Bloom filters and block indexes in the region server. Bloom filters can get as large as 100 MB per HFile, which adds up to 2 GB when aggregated over 20 regions. Block indexes can grow as large as 6 GB in aggregate size over the same set of regions. A region is not considered opened until all of its block index data is loaded. Large Bloom filters produce a different performance problem: the first get request that requires a Bloom filter lookup will incur the latency of loading the entire Bloom filter bit array.</para>
   <para>To speed up region server startup we break Bloom filters and block indexes into multiple blocks and write those blocks out as they fill up, which also reduces the HFile writer’s memory footprint. In the Bloom filter case, “filling up a block” means accumulating enough keys to efficiently utilize a fixed-size bit array, and in the block index case we accumulate an “index block” of the desired size. Bloom filter blocks and index blocks (we call these “inline blocks”) become interspersed with data blocks, and as a side effect we can no longer rely on the difference between block offsets to determine data block length, as it was done in version 1.</para>
   <para>HFile is a low-level file format by design, and it should not deal with application-specific details such as Bloom filters, which are handled at StoreFile level. Therefore, we call Bloom filter blocks in an HFile "inline" blocks. We also supply HFile with an interface to write those inline blocks. </para>
   <para>Another format modification aimed at reducing the region server startup time is to use a contiguous “load-on-open” section that has to be loaded in memory at the time an HFile is being opened. Currently, as an HFile opens, there are separate seek operations to read the trailer, data/meta indexes, and file info. To read the Bloom filter, there are two more seek operations for its “data” and “meta” portions. In version 2, we seek once to read the trailer and seek again to read everything else we need to open the file from a contiguous block.</para></section>
   <section><title>HFile format version 1 overview </title><para>As we will be discussing the changes we are making to the HFile format, it is useful to give a short overview of the previous (HFile version 1) format. An HFile in the existing format is structured as follows:

   <para>The number of entries in the block index is stored in the fixed file trailer, and has to be passed in to the method that reads the block index. One of the limitations of the block index in version 1 is that it does not provide the compressed size of a block, which turns out to be necessary for decompression. Therefore, the HFile reader has to infer this compressed size from the offset difference between blocks. We fix this limitation in version 2, where we store on-disk block size instead of uncompressed size, and get uncompressed size from the block header.</para></section></section><section><title>

   <para>A single-level version 2 block index consists of just a single root index block. To read a root index block of version 2, one needs to know the number of entries. For the data index and the meta index the number of entries is stored in the trailer, and for the Bloom index it is stored in the compound Bloom filter metadata.</para>

   <para>For a multi-level block index we also store the following fields in the root index block in the load-on-open section of the HFile, in addition to the data structure described above:</para>
   <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
         <para>Middle leaf index block offset</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
         <para>Middle leaf block on-disk size (meaning the leaf index block containing the reference to the “middle” data block of the file) </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
         <para>The index of the mid-key (defined below) in the middle leaf-level block.</para>
      </listitem>
   </orderedlist>
   <para/>
   <para>These additional fields are used to efficiently retrieve the mid-key of the HFile used in HFile splits, which we define as the first key of the block with a zero-based index of (n – 1) / 2, if the total number of blocks in the HFile is n. This definition is consistent with how the mid-key was determined in HFile version 1, and is reasonable in general, because blocks are likely to be the same size on average, but we don’t have any estimates on individual key/value pair sizes. </para>
   <para/>
   <para>When writing a version 2 HFile, the total number of data blocks pointed to by every leaf-level index block is kept track of. When we finish writing and the total number of leaf-level blocks is determined, it is clear which leaf-level block contains the mid-key, and the fields listed above are computed.  When reading the HFile and the mid-key is requested, we retrieve the middle leaf index block (potentially from the block cache) and get the mid-key value from the appropriate position inside that leaf block.</para></section>

   <section><title>getShortMidpointKey(an optimization for data index block)</title>
     <para>Note: this optimization was introduced in HBase 0.95+</para>
       <para>HFiles contain many blocks that contain a range of sorted Cells. Each cell has a key. To save IO when reading Cells, the HFile also has an index that maps a Cell's start key to the offset of the beginning of a particular block. Prior to this optimization, HBase would use the key of the first cell in each data block as the index key.</para>
     <para>In HBASE-7845, we generate a new key that is lexicographically larger than the last key of the previous block and lexicographically equal or smaller than the start key of the current block. While actual keys can potentially be very long, this "fake key" or "virtual key" can be much shorter. For example, if the stop key of previous block is "the quick brown fox", the start key of current block is "the who", we could use "the r" as our virtual key in our hfile index.</para>
     <para>There are two benefits to this:</para>
     <itemizedlist>
     <listitem><para>having shorter keys reduces the hfile index size, (allowing us to keep more indexes in memory), and</para></listitem>
     <listitem><para>using something closer to the end key of the previous block allows us to avoid a potential extra IO when the target key lives in between the "virtual key" and the key of the first element in the target block.</para></listitem>
     </itemizedlist>
     <para>This optimization (implemented by the getShortMidpointKey method) is inspired by LevelDB's ByteWiseComparatorImpl::FindShortestSeparator() and FindShortSuccessor().</para>
